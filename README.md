## Archery Competition Statistics Script

### Initialization:

- `possiblePointList`: A list containing possible point values (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 0).
- `minNumberArcher`: Minimum required number of archers.
- `nameList`: An empty list to store archer names.
- `numberArchers`: Number of archers in the competition (user input).

### Input and Validation Functions:

- `takeName(nameList, numberArchers)`: Takes names for each archer, ensuring the name doesn't include a number.
- `takePoint(numberShots, pointList, numberArchers, xAreaList, tenPointList, possiblePointList)`: Takes points for each archer's shot, validating input against possible point values.

### Statistics Function:

- `statistics(numberArchers, pointList, nameList, xAreaList, tenPointList)`: Calculates and prints archer rankings based on points, considering ties and additional criteria like the number of shots hitting the X area.

### Write Function:

- `write(archerNo2, maxIndex, nameList, pointList, tenPointList, xAreaList)`: Prints the details of the archer with the maximum points in a formatted manner. It also removes the archer's data from the lists.

### Main Function:

- `main()`: Coordinates the overall execution of the program, taking user inputs for the number of archers and shots, and then calling the necessary functions to gather data and display statistics.

### Execution:

- The program executes by calling the `main()` function at the end.

### Note:

- The script assumes valid inputs and doesn't handle all possible edge cases. Additional input validation and error handling could be added for enhanced robustness.
